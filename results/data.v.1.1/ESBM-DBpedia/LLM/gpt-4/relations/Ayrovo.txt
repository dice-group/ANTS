As of my last update in 2023, Ayrovo does not correspond to a widely recognized entity within the existing DBpedia release, and without current access to live DBpedia data, I cannot synthesize a precise list of attributes for an entity not recognized up to this point. However, for hypothetical or illustrative purposes, I can provide a list of commonly used DBpedia ontology properties that could be relevant if Ayrovo were an entity associated with topics like a location, organization, event, or person. This generic list comprises diverse relations that cover a broad spectrum of possible topics:

1. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/name
2. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/foundingDate
3. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/founder
4. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/location
5. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/industry
6. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/keyPerson
7. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/product
8. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parentCompany
9. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/subsidiary
10. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/headquarter
11. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/numberOfEmployees
12. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/revenue
13. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/netIncome
14. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/asset
15. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/operatingIncome
16. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital
17. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/isPartOf
18. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/locationCity
19. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/locationCountry
20. http://dbpedia.org/ontology/affiliate

These URIs represent a fictional or illustrative selection based on common DBpedia ontology relations that could hypothetically apply to a wide range of entities.
