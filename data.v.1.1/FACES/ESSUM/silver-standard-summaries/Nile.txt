The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,
though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.
Of the world's major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.
About 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.
In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.
In these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.
