Andrew Scott Sloan was an American lawyer, politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives (1861–1863) and served as Wisconsin's 11th Attorney General (1874–1878). For most of his political career, he was a Republican, but while serving as attorney general, he ran as a Liberal Republican, part of the short-lived Reform coalition in Wisconsin.
