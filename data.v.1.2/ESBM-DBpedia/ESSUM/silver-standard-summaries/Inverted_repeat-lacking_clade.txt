The inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC) is an informal monophyletic clade of the flowering plant subfamily Faboideae. Well-known members of this clade include chickpeas, broad or fava beans, vetch, lentils, peas, wisteria, alfalfa, clover, fenugreek, liquorice, and locoweeds. The name of this clade is informal and is not assumed to have any particular taxonomic rank like the names authorized by the ICBN or the ICPN. The clade is characterized by the loss of one of the two 25-kb inverted repeats in the plastid genome that are found in most land plants. It is consistently resolved in molecular phylogenies. The clade is predicted to have diverged from the other legume lineages 39.0Â±2.4 million years ago. It includes several large, temperate genera such as Astragalus, Hedysarum, Medicago, Oxytropis, Swainsona, and Trifolium.
