## ðŸ“¦ ESSUM (Silver-Standard Summaries) â€” Updated Version

We release an improved version of the **ESSUM-DBpedia** and **ESSUM-FACES** datasets, part of the ESSUM benchmark for evaluating **abstractive entity summarization**.

### ðŸ”§ What's New?

This update resolves a technical issue found in the earlier version, where **some entity descriptions contained more than one paragraph** from their corresponding Wikipedia articles. This was caused by a bug in the extraction script.

### âœ… Whatâ€™s Fixed?

- Each entity is now paired with **only the first paragraph** of its Wikipedia article, as originally intended.
- The correction ensures **more accurate, consistent, and concise** silver-standard summaries across the dataset.

### ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters

The improved dataset better aligns with the benchmarkâ€™s objective of evaluating models on generating **focused and informative entity summaries**. This is particularly important in domains such as **DBpedia** and **FACES**, where entity descriptions may be verbose or diverse in content.

### ðŸ“¢ Recommendation

We strongly recommend using this updated version for future experiments to ensure:
- Reliable and consistent evaluation results  
- Fair comparisons across models  
- Proper alignment with the evaluation setup defined in the ESSUM benchmark
