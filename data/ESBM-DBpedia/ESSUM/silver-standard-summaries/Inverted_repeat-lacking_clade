The inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC) is a monophyletic clade of the flowering plant subfamily Faboideae (or Papilionaceae). Faboideae includes the majority of agriculturally-cultivated legumes. The name of this clade is informal and is not assumed to have any particular taxonomic rank like the names authorized by the ICBN or the ICPN. The clade is characterized by the loss of one of the two 25-kb inverted repeats in the plastid genome that are found in most land plants. It is consistently resolved in molecular phylogenies. The clade is predicted to have diverged from the other legume lineages 39.0Â±2.4 million years ago (in the Eocene). It includes several large, temperate genera such as Astragalus L., Hedysarum L., Medicago L., Oxytropis DC., Swainsona Salisb., and Trifolium L..
