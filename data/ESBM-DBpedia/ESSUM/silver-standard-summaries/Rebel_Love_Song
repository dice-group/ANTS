"Rebel Love Song" is the fifth single by American rock band Black Veil Brides, and the third and final single from their second album Set the World on Fire. Lead vocalist Andy Biersack explained the meaning of the song in an interview with Kerrang! magazine: "That song is about the idea of finding something that you can run to, about making that Utopian society in your head and doing what you can to bust out and get there." The song won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single.
