"Love Me" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was written by Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, Ari Levine, Peter Svensson and Nina Persson, and produced by DJ Frank E. The song was released exclusively to iTunes as the first promotional single from Bieber's debut studio album, My World, on October 26, 2009.
An electropop song which also contains dance-pop and R&B elements, the chorus interpolates the 1996 single "Lovefool" by the Swedish band the Cardigans. "Love Me" was one of the most well-received tracks on the album, with critics complimenting its electro and club feel and its usage of the "Lovefool" sample.
